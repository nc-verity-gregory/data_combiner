# JSON and CSV Generator

---

## How to use

If you want to work on this locally, go ahead and clone it down. The repo is a simple react app with no back end at all.

From the pairing generator make your üçês and üçés then copy the LMS pairs to the clipboard. Paste this json into one of the learner group inputs and repeat for other learner groups.

From here name a tutor space and add rooms for all the staff you want naming them here.

When submitted the app will make you a json output of pairs for the LMS pairing tool and the option to download a joined CSV for auto breakout rooms for staff.

You can also add a L2C link and Zoom link to generate slack messages for each channel with their pairs and links.

Any issues please make a branch and submit a pull request for changes.

The whole app is hosted temporarily [here](https://6717f2e250aba38defec9279--shimmering-babka-6aac32.netlify.app/)
